# Inverted Pendulum Project - Team 6#

This projectwas carried out by a colaboration of students from ISEL (Lisbon Higher Institute of Engineering) and the University of Aplied Ciences of Amesterdam and it focuses on building and controlling an inverted pendulum, this system requires continuous feedback to stay balanced. For that feedback it will be needed some sensors, such as the AS5600 magnetic angle sensor, and a DC motor, this motor will provide the torque needed to correct deviations from upright.

# 1. Folders #

To keep our work clear, accessible, and easy to navigate, we organized the GitHub repository into a set of different folders that have all of the information obtained throughout the weeks.

## 1.1 [Code Folder:](/code) ##

This folder is divided by the different types of codes created, such as:

- [Aditional Challenges:](/code/Additional_Challenges) This folder stores all of the codes created for the additional challenges that we selected and completed;
- [Progress Codes:](/code/Progress_Codes) This folder holds the codes and the different versions of them created throughout the weeks;
- [Python:](/code/Python) This last folder has the python codes to extract information from the serial monitor of the arduino and create a graph with that information.

## 1.2 [Data Folder:](/data) ##

The data folder stores all of the data colected from the different expirements done.

## 1.3 [FeedBack Folder:](/feedback) ##

It houses all of the feedback reports done by both institutions teachers.

## 1.3 [Progress Folder:](/progress) ##

Within this folder are all of the progress reports done by the students
