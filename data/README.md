The AS5600_Angle_vs_Time.png is a graph made to showcase the sensor working and giving a live output. The pendulum was moved by using the Pendulum_Flip_Timer code from the code/Progress_Codes map.

The Arduino_Connections_Pendulum.png file is used to showcase the connections from the Arduino to the pendulum and other devices.

The Stabilising_Pendulum_PID.gif is a short video to show how different PID values change the oscillation effect of the pendulum and how they help to stabilise it.

The data.txt file was is to show how the CSV file looks like.
