- Your weekly progress report gives a decent overview of your achievements this week. A more in-depth reflection would have been better though.
- Excellent you have included the Arduino sketch in your weekly progress report. However, please write all comments in English! As an international team, you should collaborate on the same code.
- You have implemented some correction for the motor’s dead zone, but this might not be the most adequate solution.
- Great you give a clear overview of your values for the PID parameters.
- Wonderful you have included two links to video’s.
- Please move the “ramp up increment” sketch to the correct folder or delete it. In general, you should reorganize your repository by removing clutter.
- When tuning the parameters make sure you have a systematic approach. Decide on which parameters to change, observe the results and based on the results, decide which parameter to change next and by how much.
- Make sure that you report on the process and intermediate results. Explain how you made decisions and why, instead of just mentioning the final numbers.
