- This week’s progress report is too brief. It also does not include any code snippets or graphs. Please add these directly into your weekly progress update, rather than just mentioning them.
- All output-response curves appear to be missing.
- Please move the “ramp up increment” sketch to the correct folder or delete it.
- The code folder has several versions of a similar code. It is good to see your progress, but please do not save these as separate sketches. GitHub will keep track of the history every time you commit a new version.
- Wonderful your new wheel has led to better results. Well done for continuing to improve your design. And good that you have added pictures to your repository.
- Great that you included a new video of the pendulum swinging from one side to the other. However, this particular method is not recommended; switching the spin direction so suddenly can damage the motor.

General recommendations to all teams:
- Place your weekly progress reports in reverse order, with the most recent week at the top.
- Do not be afraid of Markdown. If you wish, you could start by writing a basic text file in Word and later convert it to Markdown.
- Always add annotations or description to all graphs, pictures, videos, code and data you share in your weekly progress report. Do not assume these are self-explanatory; your readers rely on your explanations to understand their relevance and importance.
- The weekly progress reports form the foundation of your final written product. The more clear, detailed, and comprehensive your reports are, the better prepared you will be to complete your final product.
