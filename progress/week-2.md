# Week 2

## 1. Progress description
Pendulum is built and complete, sensor is working, but the pendulum does not swing around. 
This is because the engine doesn't have enough power to create enough momentum to flip over the pendulum itself.

Our sollution is to create a bigger wheel for the pendulum and we are getting a new engine for the pendulum which should produce more power.

## 2. Code

You can display code using three backticks (```) followed by an optional language extension.  
For example:  
- For C/C++ code, use `c` or `cpp`.  
- For Python, use `python`.


#### Example:

```c
// Header file for input/output functions
#include <stdio.h>

// Main function: entry point for execution
int main() {

    // Print a message to the console
    printf("Hello World");

    return 0;
}
```

## 4. Reflection 

We learned how to use the pendulum and how to use the code to start the motor.
