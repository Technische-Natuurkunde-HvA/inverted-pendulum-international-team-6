# Week 4

## 1. Progress description
This week we managed to stabilise the pendulum using and when it is stable, the position of the arm is almost perfectly vertical. 
The pendulum will also restabilise itself after you give it a little push (see visuals/videos/Pendulum_stable_V1.mp4).

## 2. Code
The code had been changed so that it can stabilise the pendulum using the magnetic sensor to state the current position.
The 3 values for our parameters differ between the Dutch and Portugese group, since we have different wheels (at least for now).

Here are the parameters for the spare wheel used in Portugal (`visuals/videos/WhatsApp Video 2025-12-2 at 14.23.48.mp4`):
```
K_p = 30.0
K_i = 5.0
K_d = 1.5
```

And these are the parameters for our official wheel (`visuals/videos/Pendulum_stable_V1.mp4`):
```
K_p = 35.0
K_i = 1.0
K_d = 1.0
```


## 3. Results
Our results have been shown in the code section above, furthermore we have not decided which additional challenge we are going to choose for next week.



## 4. Reflection 
This week we achieved stabilising the pendulum and this went a lot faster than expected.
