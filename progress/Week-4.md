# Week 4

## 1. Progress description
This week we managed to stabilise the pendulum using and when it is stable, the position of the arm is almost perfectly vertical. 
The pendulum will also restabilise itself after you give it a little push (see visuals/videos/Pendulum_stable_V1.mp4).

## 2. Code

You can display code using three backticks (```) followed by an optional language extension.  
For example:  
- For C/C++ code, use `c` or `cpp`.  
- For Python, use `python`.


#### Example:

```c
// Header file for input/output functions
#include <stdio.h>

// Main function: entry point for execution
int main() {

    // Print a message to the console
    printf("Hello World");

    return 0;
}
```
