# Week 4

## 1. Progress description
This week we managed to stabilise the pendulum using and when it is stable, the position of the arm is almost perfectly vertical. 
The pendulum will also restabilise itself after you give it a little push (see visuals/videos/Pendulum_stable_V1.mp4).

## 2. Code
The code had been changed so that it can stabilise the pendulum using the magnetic sensor to state the current position.
The 3 values for our parameters differ between the Dutch and Portugese group, since we have different wheels (at least for now).

Here are the parameters for the spare wheel used in Portugal (see visuals/videos/WhatsApp Video 2025-12-2 at 14.23.48.mp4):
```
K_p = 30.0
K_i = 5.0
K_d = 1.5
```

And these are the parameters for our official wheel (see visuals/videos/Pendulum_stable_V1.mp4):
```
K_p = 35.0
K_i = 1.0
K_d = 1.0
```


## 3. Results
Present your results here. This may include tables, figures, or charts.
Add charts and other visuals to the `visuals` folder in the GitHub repository and reference them in this document if needed.
