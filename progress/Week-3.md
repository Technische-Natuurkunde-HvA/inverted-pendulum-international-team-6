# About this document

This is a team document where you record your weekly progress. It is written in Markdown, which allows you to format content in a simple and readable way. The document is rendered directly in GitHub without the need for a compiler (unlike LaTeX). The syntax is relatively easy. An overview of commonly used Markdown syntax can be found here:  
https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/

Below you find an example of the sections that must be included in each weekly progress report.

Use the **same document for all weeks**. For each week, use the **same headers and subheaders**.

Use the GitHub repository to store important project files (code, visuals including videos and figures, data, etc.). If necessary refer to those files in this document using a hyperlink.

# Week 3

## 1. Progress description

This week we made a new wheel design (bigger), which is able to flip the pendelum over as you can see in the videos @/visuals.
both teams have now access to a functional code which can flip the penedelum at certain time intervals and is able to make an output response-cure and measure the rpm of the wheel.


## 2. Code

Both teams theire codes are in the code file inside the repository.

## 3. Results

Our pendelums can now flip over, without using maximum power. We also have the ability to ramp up or down our wheel speed.

## 4. Reflection 


We learned more about github, arduino and how you can bring the pendelum in motion.
Next week our focus will be on balancing the pendelum.
